**Restricted Hartree Fock (RHF)** for Simple Atom (He and Be) using **Slator Type Orbital (STO)** with **Double ZetaÂ Basis** in Python

Integral calculated by sympy

It will be better to understand if you have read *Levine, Quantum Chemistry, 7th Edition, chapter 11 and 14*.  
There is an example calculation of Helium atom at page 412-414.
